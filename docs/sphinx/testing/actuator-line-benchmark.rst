Actuator-line benchmark: NREL 5MW Turbine
-----------------------------------------

This page documents results from an actuator-line CFD benchmark based on the NREL 5MW reference
wind turbine, as defined in the Kynema benchmark repository. The benchmark models a single NREL
5MW turbine using an actuator-line representation within a slightly convective, unstable
atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).

Fully coupled fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations performed with
Kynema-FMB and Kynema-SGF are compared against the OpenFAST–Kynema-SGF
reference solution. The purpose of this benchmark is to assess consistency in
predicted turbine-level performance and spanwise aerodynamic quantities between
the two simulation frameworks.

.. note::
   Complete details of the benchmark definition, simulation setup, inflow, and
   post-processing steps are provided in the Kynema Benchmarks documentation:
   `Kynema Benchmarks (Actuator-line NREL 5MW in a convectively unstable ABL)
   <https://kynema.github.io/kynema-benchmarks/amr-wind/actuator_line/NREL5MW_ALM_BD/README.html>`_.


Simulation cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The figures below compare multiple simulation configurations, identified in the legends as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Legend label
     - Description
   * - **OpenFAST**
     - Unchanged Kynema benchmark case (OpenFAST–Kyenma-SGF).
   * - **OF no twr**
     - Benchmark case with tower aerodynamic points disabled.
   * - **Kynema-FMB**
     - Kynema-FMB/SGF using the same time step as OpenFAST.
   * - **Kyn. 10dt**
     - Kynema-FMB/SGF using 10× the OpenFAST time step (2 Kynema FMB steps per SGF step).
   * - **Kyn. 20dt**
     - Kynema-FMB/SGF using 20× the OpenFAST time step (1 Kynema FMB step per SGF step).

The "OF, no damp,twr" case is included to isolate differences arising from damping treatment and
tower aerodynamics. The larger time-step cases (Kyn. 10dt, Kyn. 20dt) demonstrate Kynema-FMB's ability
to maintain accuracy and stability with larger time steps.


Turbine results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section compares time histories of turbine performance quantities from Kynema-FMB and OpenFAST.
The quantities shown include generator power, rotor thrust, rotor speed, blade pitch, and rotor
torque. These signals reflect both the mean operating state of the turbine and its unsteady
response to turbulent inflow and control actions.

Overall, Kynema-FMB predictions closely match the OpenFAST reference results, demonstrating consistent
aeroelastic behavior at the turbine level.

Blade loading profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To further assess the actuator-line implementation, we compare spanwise distributions of sectional
blade quantities. The results show close agreement between Kynema-FMB and OpenFAST for angle of attack,
normal and tangential force coefficients, and sectional force components.

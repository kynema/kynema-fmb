User Manual
=============

This manual will describe how to build and link against Kynema-FMB.
It also provides several examples for how to use Kynema-FMB to model and solve structural dynamics problems.
To find working versions of each of these problems, see the `tests/documentation_tests/` folder.
There, you will also find simple CMake scripts demonstrating how to link against Kynema-FMB, as described in this manual.
These examples are meant to be linked against a Kynema-FMB installation and can serve as the basis for specifying your own problem using our interfaces.
For more detailed build instructions, see the README files in their respective folders.

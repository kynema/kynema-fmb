# Kynema API documentation {#mainpage}

This document is intended for developers who want to understand the C++ code
structure and modify the codebase and, therefore, assumes that the reader is
familiar with the installation, compilation, and execution steps. If you are new to
Kynema and haven't installed/used Kynema previously, we recommend starting
with the [user manual](https://kynema.github.io/kynema/) that provides a detailed
overview of the installation process as well as general usage.

### Source code organization

Upon successful download/clone, the base repository (`kynema`) has source code
organized in subdirectories described below:

- `cmake` -- Functions and utilities used during CMake configuration phase
- `docs` -- User manual (Sphinx-based) and Doxygen files
- `src` -- C++ source files. All code is located within this directory and is
  organized into sub-directories that represent the different parts of the codebase.
- `test` -- Divided into unit-tests and regression tests, contains test files for
  the codebase

When developing new features, we strongly recommend creating a unit-test and
develop features incrementally and testing as you add capabilities. Unit-tests
are also a good way to explore the usage of individual components of the code.

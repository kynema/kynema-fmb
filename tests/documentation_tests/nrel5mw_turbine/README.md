# NREL5MW Turbine

This test shows how to run a simulation of a full wind turbine model based on a realistic specification of the IEA15MW turbine.
It uses Kynema-FMB's high level "Turbine" interface for easy definition of this common problem configuration.

To build this test, first ensure that Kynema-FMB with ROSCO has been installed somewhere that is discoverable by CMake (if using the Spack package manager, run `spack load kynema-fmb`).
Next, create a build directory and from there run `cmake ../` and `make`.
When running this test, you will need to be in the same directory as the included YAML input file, the DISCON file, and the associated Cp_Ct_Cq file.

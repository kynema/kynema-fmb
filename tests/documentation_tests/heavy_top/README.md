# The Heavy Top Problem

This simple test shows how to assemble and run a simulation of a rotating top modeled as a single point mass.
It uses Kynema-FMB's low level interface, which allows unlimited flexibility in problem specification.


To build this test, first ensure that Kynema-FMB has been installed somewhere that is discoverable by CMake (if using the Spack package manager, run `spack load kynema-fmb`).
Next, create a build directory and from there run `cmake ../` and `make`.
Note that it does not do any IO itself, so you will have to add that to inspect the results yourself.

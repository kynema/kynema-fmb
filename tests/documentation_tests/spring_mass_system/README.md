# Spring Mass System

This simple test shows how to assemble and run a simulation of a string of masses tied together by linear springs.
It uses Kynema-FMB's low level interface, which allows unlimited flexibility in problem specification.

To build this test, first ensure that Kynema-FMB has been installed somewhere that is discoverable by CMake (if using the Spack pacakge manager, run `spack load kynema-fmb`).
Next, create a build directory and from there run `cmake ../` and `make`.
Note that it does not do any IO itself, so you will have to add that to inspect the results yourself.

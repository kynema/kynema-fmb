# Rigid Body with Three Springs

This simple test shows how to run a simulation of a rigid body affected by an artificial buoyancy force and tied down by three linear springs.
It uses Kynema-FMB's high level "CFD" interface for easy definition of this common problem configuration.

To build this test, first ensure that Kynema-FMB has been installed somewhere that is discoverable by CMake (if using the Spack pacakge manager, run `spack load kynema-fmb`).
Next, create a build directory and from there run `cmake ../` and `make`.
Note that it does not do any IO itself, so you will have to add that to inspect the results yourself.
